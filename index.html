        <p>I was raised in Pueblo Colorado. I graduated from BYU in 1992 with a BS in Mechanical Engineering
            with an emphasis in technology. I married my sweetheart in 1988 and have two children</p>
        <br>
        <p> My first job out of college was working for Bath Iron Works (BIW), in Maine. BIW built Navy destroyers and
            I was employed in their IT department writing supporting software for the ship designers. That is how I
            started my career in the software industry, and have been developing software ever since. Currently my goal
            is to become a true full stack web developer, where most of my career has been in the Java stack, backend
            frameworks with JDBC, Hibernate, Servlets and Struts frameworks. My career took a detour by going into the
            management world. With that my time was more focused on improving my management skills, along with project
            management, which I tried to incorporate the agile methodologies of Scrum as my style of managment. After 5
            years in the management arena, I find myself back into the technical world and enjoying the software career
            again.</p>
        <br>
        <p> I am currently taking the University of Utah full stack bootcamp course to help me quickly get up to speed
            on the new Javascript frameworks and Javascript itself. In the course, I hope to become a proficient
            Javascript web developer, learning frameworks like MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, and NodeJS, along with
            becoming proficient the latest of HTML5 and CSS3.</p>
        <br>
        <p> Along with that, my current position is doing all Java, with Swing and Hibernate. I am also getting up to
            speed with the new Java 8 features and refreshing my skills with the Spring frameworks.</p>
